# About

Designed by Felix Summ
Initially released on June 23 on fireproofpuppydogs.com
Licensed under SIL Open Font License (1.1)

Future planned additions include:
* updated monospace (not in multiple weights yet)
* diacritics
* more glyphs
* lowercase?

# Guide

The proportional glyphs are the default style of the font. Monospace variants are located in Stylistic Set 1. In the future if all glyphs are added as monospace variants I will release the monospace variant as its own file in addition to this one.

# Donate

If you are using this font commercially or just really love the font, please consider donating. This helps future additions to the font and keeps me hard at work.

You can donate to @Felix-Summ on Venmo or felix@fireproofpuppydogs.com on Paypal.
